Homemade Wordle

Homemade Wordle is a word-guessing game created using Python and Tkinter replicating New York Times' version of the game. The game randomly selects a word from a list, and the player attempts to guess the word by inputting letters into the provided spaces. The game provides feedback on correct letters in the correct and incorrect positions. The player has a limited number of attempts, and the game ends with a win or lose message.

How to Play

    Run the program.
    The game will fetch a random word from a predefined list.
    The GUI will display spaces for each letter in the word.
    Click on the letter buttons to input your guesses.
    Delete a letter using the "Del" button if needed.
    Click the "Enter" button to submit your guess.
    The program will provide feedback on your guess, highlighting correct letters in green and correct letters in the wrong position in orange.
    Continue guessing until you either correctly guess the word or run out of attempts.
